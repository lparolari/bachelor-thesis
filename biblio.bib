  Abstract = "Coding standards and good practices are fundamental to a
              disciplined approach to software projects, whatever
              programming languages they employ. Prolog programming
              can benefit from such an approach, perhaps more than
              programming in other languages. Despite this, no widely
              accepted standards and practices seem to have emerged up
              to now. The present paper is a first step towards
              filling this void: it provides immediate guidelines for
              code layout, naming conventions, documentation, proper
              use of Prolog features, program development, debugging
              and testing.  Presented with each guideline is its
              rationale and, where sensible options exist,
              illustrations of the relative pros and cons for each
              alternative. A coding standard should always be selected
              on a per-project basis, based on a host of issues
              pertinent to any given programming project; for this
              reason the paper goes beyond the mere provision of
              normative guidelines by discussing key factors and
              important criteria that should be taken into account
              when deciding on a fully-fledged coding standard for the
              project.",
